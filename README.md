# Queen's School of Computing Student Page 🎓

Welcome to your CISC 121 student webpage repository! This guide will help you understand and navigate this GitHub repository, especially if this is your first time using GitHub.

## 📖 What is This Repository?

This repository is a **starter template** for creating your own personal Queen's Computing student webpage. Think of it as a pre-built foundation that you can customize and make your own.

**📍 Where are the full homework instructions?**  
The complete tutorial and assignment instructions are in the `index.html` file. Once you deploy your site to GitHub Pages (explained in the tutorial), you'll see a beautiful, easy-to-follow guide on your live website.

**❓ Why fork this repository instead of starting from scratch?**
- **Saves time**: You get a working template with Queen's branding already set up
- **Ensures consistency**: Everyone starts with the same structure, making peer reviews easier
- **Reduces errors**: The basic HTML structure is already correct
- **Beginner-friendly**: You can focus on personalizing content rather than building from zero

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Here's what each file in this repository does:

| File | Purpose | Will You Edit This? |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `index.html` | The main tutorial webpage with full homework instructions and your personal page template | ✅ Yes - this is where you'll add your information |
| `README.md` | This guide - helps you navigate and understand the repository | ℹ️ Optional - you can update it with your own notes |
| `LICENSE` | MIT License information (makes this project open source) | ❌ No - leave this as-is |

**What you'll be doing:** Mainly editing `index.html` to add your name, photo, interests, and contact information. The file itself contains detailed comments showing you exactly where to make changes!

## 🎯 GitHub Basics for Beginners

New to GitHub? Here are the key terms you'll need to know:

### 🗃️ Repository (Repo)
A **repository** is like a project folder that stores all your code, files, and their history. Think of it as a special folder that tracks every change you make over time.

### 🍴 Fork
**Forking** creates your own personal copy of someone else's repository. When you fork this repo, you get your own version that you can edit without affecting the original.

### 💾 Commit
A **commit** is like saving a checkpoint in a video game. It records a snapshot of your changes with a description of what you did. You can always go back to any previous commit.

### ⬆️ Push
**Pushing** uploads your local changes (commits) to GitHub's servers so they're saved online and visible to others.

### 🔀 Pull Request (PR)
A **pull request** is how you propose changes to someone else's repository. In this homework, you'll create a PR to suggest improvements to your partner's webpage.

### 🐛 Issue
An **issue** is a way to report problems, ask questions, or suggest improvements. Think of it as a discussion thread attached to a repository.

### 🌐 GitHub Pages
**GitHub Pages** is a free service that turns your repository into a live website. Your HTML file becomes a real webpage anyone can visit!

### 🌿 Branch
A **branch** is an alternate version of your code. The `main` branch is your primary version, but you can create other branches to experiment without affecting the main version.
